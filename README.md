## Summary

### About BMI

Body mass index (BMI) is a value derived from the mass and height of a person. The BMI is defined as the body mass divided by the square of the body height, and is expressed in units of kg/mÂ², resulting from mass in kilograms and height in metres. BMI is a good gauge of your risk for diseases that can occur with more body fat.
